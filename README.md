## VAY (Vietnamese Alliance Youth)

As a whole, VAY is a ministry focused on our mission and our vision.  **Our mission is to equip the local youth fellowships to disciple its members in achieving the Great Commandment and Great Commission lifestyle.**  And **our vision is that we will be a movement of Great Commission young people who are glorifying God by building Christâ€™s church.**

Part of the ministry which we serve God and work to build up the next generation of Christ's church is in and through VAY Summer Camp.  VAY Summer Camp (VAY SC) is a week long summer camp that takes place in early-August where high school students from around a number of Southern California churches gather together and retreat away from the busyness of life to study God's Word, to hear from Him, and commit to a life-long fellowship with Christ.

### Our core values are:
  **JESUS is the Focus.**
  **THE LOCAL CHURCH is the Emphasis.**
  **DISCIPLES are the End Product.**
  **SONLIFE is the Philosophy.**
  **THE GREAT COMMISSION and THE GREAT COMMANDMENT are the Backbone.**
  **THE HOLY SPIRIT is the Driving Force.**
  **VIETNAMESE YOUNG PEOPLE are the Investment.**
  **LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT is the Goal.**

## Activities Team

A sub-ministry within VAY SC is Activities Team.  The purpose of the ministry is to create enjoyable and memorable activities that create team-building and group bonding opportunities.  The activities are to be God-centered, taking the opportunity God has given to connect to God's Word through icebreakers and organized activities.  Our response offers us a way for us to be a reflection of Jesus in how we interact with our brothers and sisters.
